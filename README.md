# Resume Website - Django Final Project Programming II

- The page contains a photo of me, a short bio about me, a section of my education and work experiences with the corresponding years and dates.
- On the bottom there's a contact me form that sends e-mails from a dummy smtp server, that is included with python.
- Whole page is using django as backend and HTML/CSS/Bootsrap for frontend.
- In the future I'm planning to add a 'My projects' tab where all my projects will be shown with the respective links and also to have it hosted.
